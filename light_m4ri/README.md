# Light M4RI

This is a lighter version of the [M4RI library](http://m4ri.sagemath.org).
In order to save a few CPU cycles, it has been simplified and stripped of many functions and tests that are not required for our usage.
The `echelonize` function has been modified to allow a partial gaussian elimination.
